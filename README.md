# Deep Learning from Scratch

This repository contains the implementation of some machine learning and deep learning algorithms from scratch. By building neural networks without relying on existing deep learning frameworks, we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and mathematics involved in deep learning.

## Introduction

Deep learning has revolutionized various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. Understanding the fundamental concepts behind deep learning algorithms is crucial for effectively applying them to real-world problems. This repository provides a collection of implementations for popular deep learning algorithms, all written from scratch in Python.
